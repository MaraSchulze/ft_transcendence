# 🏓 ft_transcendence
ft_transcendence is an online pong game.  
It is the capstone project of 42school where we completely created a website from scratch.  
We finished it in a team of 5.  
The project contains docker containers, devops, backend and frontend.  

## Content
- A pong game haunted by a nearly perfect AI
- Remote players clashing in a tournament
- A tictactoe game from a different planet
- A profile page rocked in Javascript and Bootstrap
- A Django server utilizing a postgres SQL database
- And Prometheus/Graphana to the rescue
<br>
For a detailed view look into the pdf file.  

## Usage
Execute make. That will take a while, since the docker containers must be created.  
```
make
```
Then surf to
```
https://localhost:8000
```
