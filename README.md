# tictactoe_ring_edition

Each player has 2 sets of 3 rings, each with different sizes.

Players can place a larger ring over a smaller one. The color of the largest ring on a cell determines control of that cell.

The main goal is to align 3 of your colored rings in a row: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
